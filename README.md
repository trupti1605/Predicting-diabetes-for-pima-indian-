# Predicting-diabetes-for-pima-indian-
 Predicting diabetes project contains a jupyter notebook in which it tells whether patient has diabetes or not.
The dataset consists of several variables and one target variable that is outcome. The several variables are number of pregnancies,BMI,insulin level,ages.

Link for the dataset :-

1)Pregnancies: No. of times pregnant

2)Glucose: Plasma Glucose Concentration a 2 hour in an oral glucose tolerance test (mg/dl) 

3)Blood Pressure:  
Blood Pressure(mmHg):a) If Diastolic B.P &gt; 90 means High B.P (High Probability of Diabetes)
b) B.P &lt; 60 means low B.P (Less Probability of Diabetes)

4)Skin Thickness: Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (mm) – A value used to estimate body fat. Normal Triceps SkinFold Thickness in women is 23mm. Higher thickness leads to obesity and chances of diabetes increases.

5)Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml) Normal Insulin Level 16-166 mIU/L Values above this range can be alarming.

6)BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2) Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 25 is within the normal range BMI between 25 and 30 then it falls within the overweight range. A BMI of 30 or over falls within the obese range.

7)Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.

8)Age (years)

9)Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient is not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes The dependent variable is whether the patient is having diabetes or not

Data visualization is done by using 

1)Count plot

2)Histogram 

3)Heatmap 

4)Boxplot
